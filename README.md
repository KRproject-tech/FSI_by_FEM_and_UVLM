# FSI_by_FEM_and_UVLM
Fluid-Structure Interaction Analysis Using FEM and UVLM:

source code for Matlab (Windows): FSI analysis for the flapping sheet (This code is for MATLAB R2007b â€“ R2018a)

## Overview
Fluid flow is modeled using the unsteady vortex lattice method (UVLM). A flexible sheet is modeled using the finite element method (FEM) with absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) for the shell element. This is done to reproduce the deformation of a plate while considering the spanwise deformation and geometrical nonlinearity.
